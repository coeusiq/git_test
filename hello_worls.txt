This is just a test to get comfortable with Git.

I am developing on Neovim. Just got done setting up my config files (all in Lua).

I really like how those plugins are improving my workflow.
I am using Gitsigns and it is amazing how I can already see the incredible use case for it.
Also, Vim's integrated spellchecker is great.
